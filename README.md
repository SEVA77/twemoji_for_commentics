# Twemoji for Commentics

Basic set of smilies from [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) for [Commentics](https://github.com/commentics/commentics) to replace the standard one. Smilies made by [Twitter](https://github.com/twitter).

I did this for Commentics version 4.1.

To use, replace the ***smilies*** folder in `frontend/view/default/image/` with a folder from this repository.
